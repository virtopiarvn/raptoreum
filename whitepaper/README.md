# Raptoreum: Combining Smart Contracts and Ravencoins Assets For Automated Trustless Transfers

## Introduction:
Raptoreum is being designed to be a melding of Ravencoin and Smart Contracts, in doing so bringing together the strengths of Ravencoin and Smart Contracts into a very powerful, flexible, and secure platform. Ravencoins asset feature is extremely powerful while being easier to use then Ethereums smart contracts. This opens up further and great potential for the asset system, DAPP developers will now have the benefits of both Ravencoin and Smart Contracts on a platform that scales seamlessly and offers greater flexibility.

Asset and sub-asset issuance which are guaranteed to be unique names, paying dividends to holders, voting, and even messaging are possible. In addition these asstes cannot be accidentally destroyed unlike a Ethereum smart contract. But, Ravencoin assets are missing the ability to be traded trustlessly other then directly from person to person, unlike Ethereums smart contracts.

Ethereum offers great flexibility which makes it the go to for DAPP developers, somethings that has also caused it scaling issues. Raptoreum adds smart contracts to assets which allows them to be traded trustless and with automation via smart contract solving that current limitation of Ravencoin. 

Assets are handed off to the Raptoreum Masternode network which holds, verifies, and executes the smart contracts. This eliminates the scaling issues that have plagued Ethereum and while at the same time making smart contracts even more flexible as a wider array of languages may now be used for programming them.


## ASIC Resistance

Raptoreum makes the move over to ProgPow which gains ASIC resistance not through blocking or increasing memory use for example but insteadby making regular GPU hardware more efficient. This is realized by ProgPow utilizing the entire piece of hardware to the fullest making any potential benefits of an ASIC so small it no longer is worth creating an ASIC to run it.Resistance through efficiency is ProgPow (Programmatic Proof-of-Work)[1].

## Scaling

Moving the handling of smart contracts in every regard instead of adding them into blocks takes the stress and congestion created by them off the chain resulting in a blockchain that is much harder to congest and consistent low tx fees. Also this method allows us to allow larger smart contact size as well as increase the number of languages (programming) that are accepted. <further detail needed @tri)>
